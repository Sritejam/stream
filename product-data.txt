#### Projects done in Masters relevant to masters in Data Science:

**Project 1. LLM-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Query Answering**  
- **Technologies**: Python, GPT-3.5, FAISS, BERT, BM25  
- Designed and implemented a hybrid retrieval system combining FAISS for vector search, BM25 for term-based matching, and BERT for re-ranking retrieved results.  
- Created a custom semantic chunking algorithm to preprocess data into meaningful segments, enhancing retrieval precision.  
- Incorporated metadata tagging for privacy and compliance, ensuring sensitive information remained secure during retrieval and generation.  
- Utilized GPT-3.5 to generate high-quality responses for UMBC-specific queries, achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics:
  - **Mean Retrieval Score (Cosine Similarity)**: 0.5194
  - **BERTScore (F1)**: 0.8787  

**Project 2. Fine-Tuning LLMs for Treatment Prediction from Clinical Data**  
- **Technologies**: Python, Clinical BERT, Hugging Face, SMOTE  
- Developed a predictive model to identify treatments in clinical notes, achieving a **94% weighted F1-score** on highly imbalanced data.  
- Fine-tuned Clinical BERT using domain-specific embeddings, with robust handling of class imbalance via SMOTE and stratified sampling.  
- Conducted advanced preprocessing and cross-validation to ensure model reliability and generalization.  

**Project 3. Employee Attrition Prediction**  
- **Technologies**: Python, K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN  
- Designed an unsupervised learning pipeline to analyze employee attrition patterns, achieving an **86% weighted F1-score**.  
- Utilized K-Means and DBSCAN clustering combined with PCA for dimensionality reduction, uncovering actionable insights in employee retention strategies.  

**Project 4. Stock Trend Analysis**  
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy  
- Analyzed stock prices using key indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.  
- Delivered insights into market trends and trading signals through advanced data visualization techniques.
